> *"If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together."*

Welcome to the official GitHub of the **International Marine AI Consortium (IMAIC)** — a global network of researchers, engineers, conservationists, and institutions uniting to accelerate the use of artificial intelligence (AI) for ocean protection.

---

## 🚀 Vision

To empower a thriving ocean through responsible, collaborative, and cutting-edge applications of artificial intelligence.

---

## 🎯 Mission

IMAIC connects academic institutions, conservation organizations, and technology developers to:

- Develop and deploy AI tools that protect marine biodiversity and monitor ocean health
- Bridge the gap between frontier AI innovation and on-the-ground conservation
- Equip local actors with technologies to combat illegal activities and manage marine protected areas
- Facilitate open, equitable, and ethical collaboration in global ocean stewardship

---

## 🤝 How to Collaborate

We welcome contributions from a wide community of practitioners, scientists, and technologists.

### 🧭 Join the Consortium

- Organizations (research institutes, NGOs, tech companies) can apply via the [IMAIC membership process](#) and must commit to our charter values and collaboration ethics.
- Individual contributors can fork, propose improvements, and collaborate on open projects.

### 📫 Communication

- 🔗 Consortium members: use our shared platform for project coordination and updates
- 🗨 Public inquiries: open an issue or contact [info@imaic.org](mailto:fabio@gocmarineprogram.org)

## 👨‍💻 Coding Guidelines

We follow best practices for **reproducible, collaborative, and open science**:

### 1. Repositories

- Each tool or project should live in its own repository under the IMAIC organization.
- Include a `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### 2. Coding Standards

- Python: Follow [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
- R: Use [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) conventions
- AI/ML: Ensure model transparency, reproducibility, and explainability

### 3. Documentation

- All projects must use clear documentation (e.g., via `roxygen`, `Sphinx`, or `README.md`)
- Include usage examples and input/output expectations

### 4. Data Use

- Align with the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)
- Sensitive or restricted marine data must follow applicable legal and ethical guidelines
